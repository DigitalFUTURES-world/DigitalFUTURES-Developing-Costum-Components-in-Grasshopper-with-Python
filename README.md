# DigitalFUTURES Tutorial: Developing Custom Components in Grasshopper with Python



This is a Tutorial for DigitalFUTURES world.
You can Find the Part 1 video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDuJm3PfnT4&t=1670s)


## Description
Python lets us have interactive scripts, create custom commands, create new plug-ins and components, and so many other things in Grasshopper and Rhino. If you are creative enough, you can build anything with python, but the built-in components of Grasshopper are limited in some ways. We can call the rhino script syntax library to create whatever we want in python and rhino and Grasshopper. We are going to work with Hops and Python to prototype our ideas into Grasshopper components and plug-ins. Grasshopper lets us do visual programming and scripting. But there is no one size fits all solution in the architecture realm. Python will help the designers to make custom complex components. This is a door to learn how to do more with the Grasshopper and be creative with our designs.

## Learning Objectives
learning objetives of the First session:
- Understand Python in Grasshopper through hands-on examples

- Generate parametric forms with RhinoScriptSyntax, Rhino geometry & GhPython libraries

- Develop a customized surface paneling algorithm
- Examples of mesh creation and subdivision
- Working with HOPS Component adn its potential
- Making fractals and a Parametric Vault


## Environment setup and requirements
You should have Rhino 7.4 or above in order to have the HOPS properly.
Also you should Install Python. It's better not to install the latest version of Python. maybe Python 3.7 or 3.8.

 1. First Download the HOPS through *package manager* in Rhino
 2. head to the Command prompt in windows and enter:
	 

    pip install ghhops-server flask 
    	 pip install rhinoinside
